# phabric
Eclipse Mylyn plugin for phabricator

This plugin connects to the phabricator using Conduit API.
The main focus right now is to integrate the tasks module.
We are refering heavily on the Mylyn Trac code to learn about the Eclipse plugin 
ecosystem and so most of the code might be very similar to the Trac code.
